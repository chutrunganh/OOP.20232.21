# Installation ‚öíÔ∏è


**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chutrunganh/OOP.20232.21.git
```
**2. Install dependencies**

Ensure that your system is equipped with the Java JDK, specifically version 8.0 or above, and corresponding JavaFX version. It is also crucial to add the VM option to your IDE to ensure proper functionality:
```plaintext
--module-path ${PATH_TO_FX} --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media
```
*Replace ${PATH_TO_FX} with the actual path to the `lib` directory of JavaFX in your machine.*

Upon successful completion of the above steps, you are prepared to commence exploration of the project.
